  I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Information Systems Group (ISG)](https://isg.ics.uci.edu/) at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Michale J. Carey](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~mjcarey/). I'm also a research associate at the [Center for Complex Engineering Systems at KACST and MIT](http://cces.kacst.edu.sa/).

  My research targets the storage engines in Big Data Management Systems. In particular, I work on reducing the storage size to accelerate scan-based analytical workloads for document store systems.
